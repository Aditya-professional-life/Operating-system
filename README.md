### 1. What is an Operating System?

An **Operating System (OS)** is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, providing common services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between the user and the computer hardware. 

Key functions include:
- **Resource Management**: Manages CPU, memory, disk drives, and peripheral devices.
- **Process Management**: Handles the creation, scheduling, and termination of processes.
- **Memory Management**: Manages system memory or RAM and ensures proper allocation to processes.
- **File System Management**: Organizes, stores, and retrieves data from the storage system.
- **Security and Access Control**: Protects system data and resources from unauthorized access.

#### Examples of Operating Systems:
- **Windows**: Popular for desktops and personal computers.
- **Linux**: Open-source OS used for servers and development.
- **MacOS**: OS for Apple devices.
- **Android/iOS**: Mobile operating systems.
